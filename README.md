Notes
ide: Visual Studio 2015



Questions:
	How do I create and use a dll?
	What is a namespace?
		The namespace tells the ide where to find a csharp class.    The namespace also allows use to shortcuts, So for example 'using System' allows us to use Console, but if we didnt we would have to call it
			by using System.Console.   The ssytem is located on disk in the Microsoft.NET framework folder as a dll -> 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\System.dll'.
